HouseIraeCourt1;Arrival at House Irae;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeCourt1Arrival;\n \n  You have finally reached the cavernous depths of the Underdark, the realm of the Dark Elves. As the secluded race has little need of light, thanks to their enhanced night vision, the only torches around are those for ceremonial purposes. Thankfully it is enough to guide your way to the main throne room of House Irae. \n  Before you, sitting on a grand throne made of silver in the shape of a giant spider, is the Matron Mother herself, Kekvit Irae. Even in the dim light, it is apparent that she is wearing little except for a pair of high heeled boots and a very translucent robe. She is flanked on either side by male guardsmen, presumably for show only. You know from whispered rumors that the real guards stalk the throne room's shadows, unseen and deadly. \n  "Welcome to House Irae, outsider," the Matron speaks. Her lip curls into a smirk as she sizes you up for unknown purposes. "You have done much to earn my favor, and I wish to impart a grand boon upon you. You can choose to take this boon from me..." her words drift off as her fingers trail up her dark skin to caress a breast, "...or from one of my children." The tease stops as Kekvit's hand moves to the side to point toward three figures. A woman, a man, and a girl. All modestly dressed, by dark elf standards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeCourtArrival1;"I choose you, Matron Mother.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeCourtArrival2;"I choose one of your children, Matron Mother.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeCourt2;An audience with Kekvit Irae;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeCourt2M;\n \n  The Matron licks her lips as she hears the honeyed words coming from your mouth. "You have chosen well, outsider," she speaks, crooking her finger at you, enticing you over to her. As if that wasn't invitation enough, Kekvit pulls aside her robe and spreads her legs. Already you can see beads of wetness glistening from her pussy, the sight of which is making your trousers extremely tight. "Come, outsider," she commands. "Take your boon." \n  With no further encouragement needed, you cautiously approach the wanton Matron and unleash your tool from the confines of your clothes. Now standing before the silver throne, you lift up Kekvit's legs and rest them on your shoulder while your shaft aims for its target. "Do it," your new lover commands. With one single thrust of your body, you hilt yourself inside her, almost breaching her inner gate with the force. \n  Sounds of moaning and flesh slapping upon flesh fill the halls of the throne room as you vigorously pound into the Matron Mother. Even though she has had countless children, her pussy is as tight as a virgin. The unfortunate side effect from this is that you aren't able to hold out for very long, and very soon you push with one final thrust against her cervix and unleash your life-giving seed into Kekvit's womb. \n  Despite just filling the Matron, she doesn't let you go, her arms wrapped tightly around your body. She means to get her fill of pleasure, by any means possible. The lovemaking goes on for several hours until you are completely spent and exhausted. At long last, the Matron releases you and forcefully pushes you off of her and onto the ground with her heeled boot. "That was just for fun," the Matron giggles out, unfazed by the hours she spent fucking. "I like you, outsider, so I'll give you a choice of a boon. You can either have your body and mind strengthened, or enjoy a little special gift." \n  Breathlessly, you reply...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeCourt2F;\n \n  The Matron licks her lips as she hears the honeyed words coming from your mouth. "You have chosen well, outsider," she speaks, crooking her finger at you, enticing you over to her. As if that wasn't invitation enough, Kekvit pulls aside her robe and spreads her legs. Already you can see beads of wetness glistening from her pussy, the sight of which is making your own underside dampen. "Come, outsider," she commands. "Take your boon." \n  With no further encouragement needed, you cautiously approach the wanton Matron and kneel down before her. Her honeyed scent is intoxicating! The Matron places both of her legs onto your shoulder and uses them to force your head down to her. The intoxicating effect prevents you from resisting, even if you wanted to, and soon your lips close over her darkened nub. A small moan escapes Kekvit's lips as your tongue starts forcing its way into her. Despite having countless children, the woman is as tight as a virgin. \n  Sounds of moaning fill the halls of the throne room as you vigorously bite, lick, and suckle the Matron Mother's flower. The lovemaking goes on for several hours. Sometimes you become the giver, sometimes the receiver, and sometimes you both enjoy each other at the same time, all the while her children look on. Both the man and the woman have a lustful look in their eyes as they watch the lovemaking, while the girl hides behind the man and keeps her eyes averted. She is clearly embarrassed at the scene, but cannot disobey her mother by leaving. At last, you are completely spent and exhausted, finding yourself cuddled in the lap of Kekvit atop her throne. "That was just for fun," the Matron giggles out, unfazed by the hours she spent fucking, before pushing you off of her and onto the ground. "I like you, outsider, so I'll give you a choice of a boon. You can either have your body and mind strengthened, or enjoy a little special gift." \n  Breathlessly, you reply...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

HouseIraeCourt3M;\n \n  The Matron Mother snaps her fingers and the three figures present themselves to you. \n  "Freya Irae," Kekvit speaks, motioning toward the woman. "My favorite, though at times can be a handful." The tall woman has short white hair and her face has a large scar across it. Unlike her mother, Freya looks dressed for battle, decked out in a black leather bodice and a flowing red skirt that hangs down to her ankles, with twin daggers sheathed at both sides of her hip. A sneer crosses Freya's face and a glare is directed toward Kekvit mention of being a handful crosses her ears, though the expression soon fades when she gets a good look at you. You can almost see her mentally undressing you. \n  "Khaldune Irae," the Matron continues, motioning toward the man. "A male, but my favorite son." The man gives you no time to inspect him before snorting his disapproval at you and storming out the room, forcing the little girl who was taking refuge behind him to hide behind her sister. "Never mind him," Kekvit says, waving her hand dismissively. "He has his preferences." \n  "Deionarra Irae," Kekvit speaks in a low, disapproving tone at the little girl. "Though the three are triplets, this... failure... somehow stopped growing." The girl, looking no older than a human of thirteen years- if that much- shyly peeks her head out from behind Freya and meekly squeaks out a hello. "SILENCE!" shouts the Matron, and the girl returns back to hiding in her sister's skirt. \n\n  "Now then, which one would you like a boon from? The strong and able Freya? Or the failure?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

"My favorite, though at times can be a handful." The woman gives you no time to inspect him before snorting her disapproval at you and storming out the room. "Never mind her," the Matron speaks, waving her hand dismissively. "She gets jealous around other women, especially ones I favor."\n  "Khaldune Irae," the Matron continues, motioning toward the man. "A male, but my favorite son." The man stands tall, likely six feet in height, maybe more. Unlike his mother, Khaldune dresses modestly in red robes, with only a single dagger sheathed at his side as his only (apparent) protection. You can see him mentally undressing you. Despite his lustful gaze, it is clear from his stance that is much more on guard than anyone else in the room.\n  "Deionarra Irae," Kekvit speaks in a low, disapproving tone at the little girl. "Though the three are triplets, this... failure... somehow stopped growing." The girl, looking no older than a human of thirteen years- if that much- shyly peeks her head out from behind Khaldune and meekly squeaks out a hello. "SILENCE!" shouts the Matron, and the girl returns back to hiding in her brother.\n\n  "Now then, which one would you like a boon from? My prodigal son? Or the failure?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

HouseIraeCourt5;\n \n  "Come with me," Freya speaks in a commanding voice before moving off toward one of the side passages. You have no choice but to follow her, lest you anger either her or her mother. "I will train your body and hone your skill, as only a warrior can."\n  An hour goes by and you are still following her down the dark passages of the Underdark. You begin to wonder if it is a trap before Freya suddenly grabs you and forces you down on the ground onto your back. In an almost blinding speed, the daughter removes her skirt and kneels before you, deftfully pulling out your cock and stroking it until it gets hard. Before you can object, the woman climbs up on top of you, straddling your body, and places a finger upon your lips to hush whatever objections may come. "What my mother doesn't know wont kill you." Freya gracefully sinks down onto your manhood, rolling her eyes up in pleasure as she is penetrated. "And if she does find out, then my tongue has a way of soothing her anger."\n  "By Lolth, this feels great..." she moans out before hastily untying her bodice. It spills out onto the floor, and you are graced by the sight of her large, dark breasts. "It's been too long since I've had a good cock in me."\n  Freya starts to move her body, and before long she is bouncing with reckless abandon. Your hands reach up to grope her flailing tits, trying hard to hold back them stemming tide in your loins. "Yes! Yes!" Freya starts screaming out in pleasure. "Fuck a baby into me! Make me a mother!" You oblige her command by grabbing the woman and rolling her onto her back, still pounding away at the daughter's pussy until a groan and a final thrust marks the beginning of the woman's path to motherhood.\n  Seed spills from Freya's pussy as you withdraw, and the woman proudly shows off your work. "Not bad, for an outsider," the woman purrs in contentment. You both hurriedly dress yourselves before you are caught. "You have given me a boon, so now take my boon." She slips a small silver amulet into your hand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

HouseIraeCourt6M;\n \n  You can see little Deionarra silently freaking out that you have chosen her. Despite her craven nature, she accepts her fate to be chosen and runs off to a side room. "Whatever," Kekvit says, rolling her eyes. "Go to that little freak if you wish." Freya, on the other hand, simply shrugs and moves off to parts unknown. If a male does not pick her, then he is unworthy of her attention.\n  Following the little girl into the side room, you are stunned to discover that it's actually a library. An extremely large one at that, with bookcases going at least three stories tall. You find little Deionarra sitting on the floor, sobbing to herself. She looks up at you and frowns, then looks away. "Mother wants me to... to..." Deionarra cant bring herself to finish the sentence. "But I'm loyal to my husband! I would never do that!" You assure the girl that you're not here for that, and Deionarra smiles weakly and wipes away her tears before standing up. Only now do you notice that the girl is at least several months pregnant!\n  "Mother hates me because I'm so small, but she keeps me around because I've surpassed her in the magical arts." You can see her demeanor brighten instantly. "And because keeping me around keeps my husband, Khal, happy!" Khal? As in Khaldune, her brother? Before you have a chance to ask, the girl slams a couple books onto a nearby table. "I can teach you a minor spell as my boon!" The books are in a language you've never seen before, and Deionarra gives no indication as to which is which, so you are forced to pick...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

"Whatever," Kekvit says, rolling her eyes. "Go to that little freak if you wish." Khaldune, on the other hand, seethes with anger and rage, all directed at you. He's quite protective of his sister, apparently, but can take no action while in the presence of his mother.\n  Following the little girl into the side room, you are stunned to discover that it's actually a library.

HouseIraeCourt6TTA;...a red book.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeCourt6TTA1;The red book is bound in leather and its pages are sparsely splattered with blood. Deionarra explains that she utilizes this tome to aid wounded soldiers returning from raids.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeCourt6TTB;...a pink book.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeCourt6TTB1;The pink book has plenty of pictures of dark elves in... compromising positions, all of them nude and drawn in explicit detail. The pages are well worn and smell faintly of a woman's sex. Deionarra doesn't say anything, instead turning away and blushing a bright purple hue. It would appear that she grabbed one of her own personal tomes by mistake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeCourt6TTC;...a white book.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

HouseIraeCourt7Khaldune1;\n \n  Khaldune's lip curl up into a half-sneer as you decide to receive his boon. The little girl hiding behind him looks dejected, and saunters off alone. "Teach her about the art of the blade," Kekvit commands her son. It seems that he is all too eager to obey. "Follow me," Khaldune commands as he leaves to a side room off from the throne room. Eager to not arouse the anger of the Matron, you follow, and find yourself in a training room of sorts, with stuffed training dummies off to one side and paintings of human anatomy and weak spots hanging from the walls.\n  Khaldune hands you a spare dagger of his, and you two spend the next few hours refining the art of precision strikes against the training dummies. Suddenly, and without warning, Khaldune slips behind you and holds his dagger at your throat, using his free hand to slip inside your bodice, groping your breasts. "Mother commanded me to teach you how to use a blade, and now I'm going to do just that. Experience is a harsh teacher." The man pulls his hand out from your clothes and pushes you down to the floor face-first, with him on top of you. You can feel his manhood pressing against your nether region, and you know what is going to happen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeCourtKhalduneWillBeRaped;"No! Stop! Please!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeCourtKhalduneWillBeRaped2;You are unable to resist!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeCourtKhalduneWillBeRough;"Two can play at this game, asshole!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeCourtKhalduneWillBeRough2;You turn the tables on Khaldune!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeCourt7KhalduneRaped;Raped!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeCourt7KhalduneRapedT;\n \n  "No," Khaldune plainly tells you as you feel a second dagger draw down your back, cutting through the clothing like butter. A moment's silence before you feel his fingers running over your ass and down to your pussy. You grit your teeth as his fingers invade your private area. Relief at last as his fingers withdraw, but you know that relief won't last long. And not long at all before you feel something bigger push into you.\n  With the razor-sharp blade still at your throat and now his hand holding your head down, all you can do is endure as Khaldune brutally violates you. You try to hold back the tears as his shaft thrusts into your dry nethers, each thrust accompanied by the sound of his hips slapping against your ass. It's not long, however, before your body betrays you for its instinctual need to breed, and the rape gets easier with every thrust as your pussy starts to become wet.\n  A moan escapes your lips, half out of shame and half out of unwilling pleasure. "Louder," Khaldune commands. With his blade cutting into your neck, you have no choice but to comply. You let out a weak moan, hoping it will satisfy him for the moment. It doesn't. "Louder!" His free hand gives your ass a hard slap in time with his thrusting, causing yet another involuntary moan to escape your lips. "LOUDER!" It's not long before you are moaning like a whore. Mentally and emotionally, you know this is wrong, but your body disagrees. The fires of lust are building in your womb until eventually you feel the explosion of pleasure wrack your body as Khaldune thrusts one last time, penetrating your inner gate and filling your womb with his seed.\n  You know not how long you lost consciousness for, but when you awaken there is a fresh set of clothes folded neatly on the floor next to you with a dagger on top with an accompanied note, 'A good little whore always needs to be paid.' You feel dirty and spend the next hour crying in the corner in shame before finally getting the courage to dress yourself and leave.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeCourt7KhalduneRapedTT;"That fucking asshole...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeCourt7KhalduneRough;Tables Turned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeCourt7KhalduneRoughT;\n \n  You feel a dagger cut down your back through the clothes, letting the cloth spill onto the floor. You are not going to let this... child... violate you. With a swift sweep of your leg, you trip Khaldune and jump to your feet, now stark naked. Grabbing the spare dagger you were training with, you move over to the stunned man, his cock proudly pointing upwards in the air, and straddle the man, sinking down onto his manhood while pressing the blade to his throat. "Enjoying it now?" you sneer at him.\n  A swift punch to your face from Khaldune knocks you to the side and you're suddenly pinned to the ground, his cock once again penetrating your now-soaking nether region. There is something... enticing about this fight you are having with him, and let out a moan as he begins thrusting. You haven't surrendered yet, and your dagger flashes across your rapist's chest, drawing blood and knocking the man back. You take the opportunity to jump to your feet and kick him back down so you can take your rightful place as the dominant.\n  This back and forth goes on for a good full hour. Sometimes you let him "win" to enjoy the pleasure of the rough fucking only to overtake him again and establish your dominance. At long last, you feel his cock swell within you, signalling the end of this little game of yours. It could be the taste of blood on your lips, or the feeling of his submission, but your body responds in kind. You both come together, his juices mixing with yours.\n  After recovering, you get up and attempt to put on what little clothes are still salvageable. Khaldune still lays on the floor, bloodied and unconscious. Being the opportunist, you take his dagger as a trophy. Before exiting the training room, you look down at the pitiful man.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeCourt7KhalduneRoughTT;"That was fun, thank you." (kick him);;;;;;;;;;;;;x

HouseIraeCourtLeftKekvitSex;\n \n  Still breathless from your round of fun with the Matron Mother, you struggle to your feet. Kekvit, on the other hand, has no such frailty. She effortlessly gets up off her throne and glides toward you with the grace only a dark elf could manage. The woman wraps her fingers around your neck, and you fear this may be the end, but suddenly the Matron pulls you into a kiss. Not just any kiss, but one that restores your vigor and makes your mind sharper. "Enjoy my boon," she whispers, running her sultry fingers across your cheek, "you will not be allowed to return."\n  The Matron sneers over toward the cowering child. "Deionarra!" The girl is shaken and frightened, but presents herself before her mother. "Open a portal back to the outsider's home." Deionarra doesn't reply with words. She knows that anything she says will be met with punishment, and thus she merely bows her head and starts chanting. A flash of light blinds you, and you suddenly are standing back at home in the mundane world.\n\n  The boon the Matron granted you has sharpened your wits and your muscles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

HouseIraeCourtLeftDeionarra;\n \n  You spend several hours learning from the little mage and getting to know her. It was not hard to get her to come out of her shell... all she needed was someone to speak to who would not talk down to her. Satisfied with your new spellcasting ability, Deionarra walks you back out the room, arm in arm.\n  As you exit, however, you are quickly ambushed by Khaldune and thrown against the wall, dagger blade held to your throat. He leans in and wordlessly sniffs the air around you, presumably to search for any sign of violation of his wife. One grunt of approval later and the dagger is sheathed before moving to hug Deionarra close. You choose to leave quickly before he changes his mind.\n  Returning to the main throne room, the Matron Mother narrows her gaze at you. "I hope you learned something from my worthless daughter." Before you can reply, both Deionarra and Khaldune enter into the room, with the girl happily clinging to her husband. Khaldune, in kind, holds her tight with an uncharacteristic smile on his face as he gazes down at his wife. It doesn't take a genius to know that the two truly love each other.\n  The Matron sneers over toward the child. "Deionarra!" The girl is shaken and frightened, but presents herself before her mother. "Open a portal back to the outsider's home." Deionarra doesn't reply with words. She knows that anything she says will be met with punishment, and thus she merely bows her head and starts chanting. A brief moment after the chanting stops, Deionarra flashes you a happy smile. A flash of light blinds you, and you suddenly are standing back at home in the mundane world.\n\n  You wonder how you will make use of your new magical spell, and start to plan on building and expanding a library of your own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeCourtLeftFreya;\n \n  Both you and Freya return from the dark caverns to the throne room. "I assume your training session went well?" the Matron asks inquisitively, cocking an eyebrow at the two of you. Considering her influence and intelligence, there is no way she cant know of your illicit liaison with her daughter. After all, you are wearing Freya's amulet around your neck. Whether or not she knows is moot, however, as Kekvit dismissively waves you two off.\n  The Matron sneers over toward her other daughter. "Deionarra!" The girl is shaken and frightened, but presents herself before her mother. "Open a portal back to the outsider's home." Deionarra doesn't reply with words. She knows that anything she says will be met with punishment, and thus she merely bows her head and starts chanting. A brief moment after the chanting stops, you can see Freya rubbing her belly in a motherly fashion. A flash of light blinds you, and you suddenly are standing back at home in the mundane world.\n\n  Freya's boon has increased your martial prowess, but you are still uncertain about what the amulet does...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeCourtLeftKhaldune1;\n \n  The clothes feel dirty. You feel dirty. Your will was broken by the Matron Mother's son, and yet there is nothing you can do about it except leave to the throne room. Khaldune is there, as is his mother and two sisters. You cant even look him in the eyes. Kekvit must know what had happened, but she's not saying anything. Both of them have wide smirks on their faces. The child clinging to Khaldune is blissfully unaware, so you try to look your best, at least for her sake.\n  The Matron sneers over toward her craven child. "Deionarra!" The girl is shaken and frightened, but presents herself before her mother. "Open a portal back to the outsider's home." Deionarra doesn't reply with words. She knows that anything she says will be met with punishment, and thus she merely bows her head and starts chanting. A brief moment after the chanting stops, you can see Khaldune giving you a wink. A flash of light blinds you, and you suddenly are standing back at home in the mundane world.\n\n  Though Khaldune has violated you, at the very least you came away alive, and with sufficient subterfuge training. You examine the dagger he left, wondering if it holds magical power. You subconsciously rub your belly in a motherly way as you ponder the dagger's uses...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeCourtLeftKhaldune2;\n \n  After giving Khaldune one last kick in the side, you scrounge around for something to wear. None of your clothes can be salvaged. It's just as well, as your body is so badly bloody and bruised that anything you wear now will get ruined. Instead, you toss aside your scraps and walk proudly out into the main throne room naked, holding your head high. The Matron and her daughters see you, the mother giving you a respectful nod. It's quite clear that the dominance of a woman is held in high regards in House Irae, even for an outsider.\n  The Matron sneers over toward her craven child. "Deionarra!" The girl is shaken and frightened, but presents herself before her mother. "Open a portal back to the outsider's home." Deionarra doesn't reply with words. She knows that anything she says will be met with punishment, and thus she merely bows her head and starts chanting. A flash of light blinds you, and you suddenly are standing back at home in the mundane world.\n\n  Khaldune tried to have his way with you, but in the end it was you who came out the winner. Despite wielding both the knowledge of his training session and his personal dagger, you cant shake the feeling that you came away with more than that as you subconsciously rub your belly in a motherly way...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
