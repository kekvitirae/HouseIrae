HouseIraeTamsineCurse;The Curse of Tamsine Irae;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeTamsine20;\n \n  In your youth, you were a perfectly normal child. Despite being a bastard child of House Irae, you were welcomed by your other parent and raised as their own flesh and blood.\n  The day after your sixteenth birthday, however, changed everything. It started small, with just a cough or a sneeze, but suddenly you doubled over in pain, with barely enough strength to call out to a nearby maid. The court physician examined you and determined that your bones and flesh have become as weak and as feeble as an old man's.\n  Now I spend most of my time laying in bed, wondering when death will claim me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeTamsine20TT;I feel so weak...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Despite being a bastard child of House Irae, you were welcomed by your other parent and raised as their own flesh and blood.\n  The day after your sixteenth birthday, however, changed everything. Before, you had no qualms about flirting with the other girls, occasionally sneaking in a kiss or something more, but now the desire to do anything of that nature disappears from your mind. Just the thought of sticking parts of your anatomy into someone makes you want to dry heave. Potential lovers are now seen as just friends, and you feel absolute disgust over the thought of marriage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Once, [From.GetFirstName] would steal kisses or more from the courtier girls, but now it seems as he is uncomfortable with anything more than just a friendly hug. I tried to talk to him about marriage and continuing the family line, but each time I do he dry heaves at the very mention of sex...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

HouseIraeTamsine40;\n \n  In your youth, you were a perfectly normal child. Despite being a bastard child of House Irae, you were welcomed by your other parent and raised as their own flesh and blood.\n  The day after your sixteenth birthday, however, changed everything. Once kind and gentle, your mind drifted to darker thoughts. Blood, rape, murder, torture... all these must be experienced in full glory. You snuck into the kitchen where a maid was working on tonight's meal. When it was finished, you holding a bloodied knife in your hands with the maid's body crumbled on the ground, her throat slit.\n  And you enjoyed every moment of it. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeTamsine40TT;I should visit the torture chamber...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Despite being a bastard child of House Irae, you raised [From.GetHerHim] as any other child.\n  The day after [From.GetHerHis] sixteenth birthday, however, changed everything. A scream came from the kitchen, and upon investigating I found a few scullery maids looking on in shock and horror at the body of another maid, crumbled to the ground with her throat slit.\n  I ordered my guards to start an investigation into who murdered this poor woman, but it wasn't long before I found the culprit... my own child, [From.GetFirstName], was sitting in [From.GetHerHis] room, playfully toying with a bloodied kitchen knife, licking and savoring the vitae like it was ambrosia. I decided to quickly back out of the room when [From.GetSheHe] flashed me a glance and an evil grin...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeTamsine50;\n \n  In your youth, you were a perfectly normal child. Despite being a bastard child of House Irae, you were welcomed by your other parent and raised as their own flesh and blood.\n  The day after your sixteenth birthday, however, changed everything. It started as a mild distrust of the maids and servants, until suddenly you found yourself locked in your room knowing that there are enemies everywhere just waiting to stab you in the back. Even your own parent is in on the plot to kill you! The only thing you can trust is your own blade, and even that is suspect as it was forged by someone else. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeTamsine50TT;There are enemies all around me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Despite being a bastard child of House Irae, you raised [From.GetHerHim] as any other child.\n  The day after [From.GetHerHis] sixteenth birthday, however, changed everything. Once, [From.GetFirstName] was calm and collective, but today I noticed that [From.GetSheHe] was more argumentive than normal, starting with an argument with a maid over poisoning his food, then accusing me of joining in the plot, and finally ending with him storming back to his room, muttering things about conspiracies everywhere...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Despite being a bastard child of House Irae, you were welcomed by your other parent and raised as their own flesh and blood.\n  The day after your sixteenth birthday, however, changed everything. While enjoying a meal with your family and courtiers, a dark voice whispered into your ear, "Unworthy." You doubled over the table in pain. The dinner guests called for the physician, but it was too late... your legs violently and painfully split apart and starting growing a chitinous exterior, while the rest of your lower body grew to monsterous size.\n  The dinner guests were appalled at what they now saw and dared not approach. Your lower body, once lithe and normal, has shifted into the shape of black widow spider. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Despite being a bastard child of House Irae, you were welcomed by your other parent and raised as their own flesh and blood.\n  The day after your sixteenth birthday, however, changed everything. While enjoying a meal with your family and courtiers, you felt an odd sensation around your groin and your chest. The odd sensation grew too painful, so you excused yourself from the table and ran to your room. The pain soon subsided, and you started to examine your body to determine the cause. By your horror, you discovered that you now have a pair of female breasts on your chest, and your once-proud penis is gone and was replaced with a vagina! A quick glance in the mirror revealed that you are, indeed, a woman. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

[From.GetHerHis] legs violently and painfully split apart and starting growing a chitinous exterior, while the rest of [From.GetHerHis] lower body grew to monsterous size.\n  The dinner guests were appalled at what they now saw and dared not approach.

She then excused herself to her room under the guise of feeling sick, but somehow I knew it was more than this. Later, after the dinner, I went up to [From.GetFirstName]'s room and entered, only to be surprised by a male of her age, standing nude in front of the mirror. I was just about to demand answers when he looked me in the eyes.\n  Those eyes... I recognize those eyes anywhere! This man before me IS my daughter! Something happened and now my beautiful [From.GetFirstName] is a boy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Despite being a bastard child of House Irae, you were welcomed by your other parent and raised as their own flesh and blood.\n  The day after your sixteenth birthday, however, changed everything. It started small with the need to hoard your allowance. Soon you stopped flirting with the commoners and instead started flirting with the nobility, even the married ones. Eventually, your thoughts soon turned to claiming a title for yourself, and demanding only the best. Your family is now a major roadblock to claiming what you want, and you will stop at nothing to become ruler of the world. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

I even caught her sitting atop my throne, claiming it was [From.GetHersHis] by right of birth. When I demanded that she got down, I heard [From.GetFirstName] mutter under [From.GetHerHis] breath that [From.GetSheHe] will eventually claim the throne one way or another...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Even after your sixteenth birthday, when the world recognizes you as a true adult, nothing out of the ordinary has afflicted your mind or body. It seems you are safe... for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeTamsine80TT;Just another normal day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

HouseIraeTamsine100T;An Unexpected Visitor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeTamsine100;\n \n  It happened quite suddenly.\n  It was a typical stormy night. While you were combing [dark_whispers_child.GetFirstName]'s hair to prepare [dark_whispers_child.GetHerHim] for bed, there was a loud pounding on the bedroom door. Thinking it was just another of your maidservents wanting something, you called out for them to come in. What surprised you was that the person pounding at the door was not one of your servents, but a hooded woman, sheathed in a dark cloak with a red hourglass clasp, soaking wet from- presumably- the rain outside. As you were about to call for the guards- how did she even get past them?- the woman removes the cloak to reveal a human with deep red hair and the clothing to match one of your typical maidservents. After quickly shaking off the water from her cloak, the woman pulls out an envelope and hands it toward you, the symbol of House Irae pressed into the sealed wax.\n  "Rose," she speaks plainly. "Rose Hemlock." She makes no motion as you quickly open up the letter in hopes of finding some answers, though [dark_whispers_child.GetFirstName]'s eyes light up and [dark_whispers_child.GetHerHis] mood brightens considerably at the presence of this Rose.\n\n     I have ordered this slave to live with you and care for my blood.\n     She is extremely loyal, and will perform whatever tasks you require of her.\n     Use her well.\n     -Kekvit Irae, Matron Mother\n\n  It would seem that you have no choice but to take in this woman, moreso now that [dark_whispers_child.GetFirstName] has taken a liking to the woman, as evidenced by the child's begging that we keep "Auntie Rose." Instinctively, you know that this sudden infatuation by [dark_whispers_child.GetFirstName] is not typical, and there are likely other forces at work. Due to the child's desire for the woman to stay, Rose is now your servant whether you like it or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeTamsine100TT;Welcome to our abode.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeTamsine102T;Mother is Coming;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeTamsine102Child;\n \n  A horrendous thing has happened! A murder has occuried within your own home.\n  You know not when it happened or who did it, but you were soon notified by the screams of a maidservent who discovered the grisly scene. There, lying on the floor of [houseirae_murdered.GetHerHis] own bedroom, was your flesh and blood... your child... [houseirae_murdered.GetFirstName].\n\n [houseirae_murdered.GetHerHisCap] body lays mutilated, skin flayed, and limbs severed in a ritualistic manner. Beneath the body was an intricate pentagram drawn in blood, and the same-self blood was used to write the words 'Mother is Coming' on the walls.\n\n An investigation by your spymaster has begun in full, but for now there is little to do but mourn the loss of your child...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

HouseIraeTamsine104TTA;Again?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeTamsine106T;A New Plague;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeTamsine106;\n \n  Word has reached you that there is a new, strange sickness spreading through your lands.\n\n What is most strange, however, is the fact that dark elves seem to be completely immune to this plague. The humans and halfbreeds of the land are the ones who taking the full brunt of the damage. The disease kills quickly, and the reports from the doctors tell that the reposing corpses have a permanent smile on their faces.\n\n Moving quickly through the hold to find out anything more of this new disease, I stumble upon [dark_whispers_child.GetFirstName] and Rose, her human nanny, in their room, hunched over the corpse of a human maid. Just as I try to express my concern to Rose about the danger, she lifts her hand to silence me. "Both [dark_whispers_child.GetFirstName] and I have have embraced Mother's Love," she speaks plainly without a hint of emotion. "Fear not about us, we are safe." In contrast to Rose's stoic manner to the corpse laying before them, [dark_whispers_child.GetFirstName] bounds up to me with a wide smile on her face. "Mother has chosen you to be the herald of her loving embrace," she happily speaks, bouncing on her feet in excitement.\n\n Before I have a chance to ask what the two are talking about, Rose takes the girl by the hand and exits the room. Before crossing the threshhold of the door, the woman turns to me and gives me a sinister-looking smirk. "Soon the whole world will know of her Motherly Love.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeTamsine106TTA;Motherly Love?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeTamsine106TTB;I need to find out who Rose really is...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

HouseIraeTamsine109T;Sexual Awakening;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeTamsine109NoIncest;\n \n  It has been a couple years since the outbreak of Motherly Love, and the land was left battered and broken.\n\n  On of my rounds through the hold to check in on the family before turning into bed, I walk in [dark_whispers_child.GetFirstName]'s bedroom to find both her and Rose completely nude on the bed, with my child kneeling on the floor with her face between Rose's legs. [dark_whispers_child.GetFirstName] is at the age where she's thinking about sex, so I quietly start to make my way out of the room and give them both some privacy.\n\n  Before I do, however, I notice that Rose is unmoving. Not only that, but her body is covered in blood and bruises, her belly sliced wide open by a knife sitting to the side of [dark_whispers_child.GetFirstName]! My child hears the gasp coming from my mouth and stands up, turning toward me with a wide smirk on her blood-stained face. "She was a good tutor," my girl remarks. "She willingly gave her body, her life, and her soul so that Mother may come."\n\n  I am left stunned at the grisly scene before me as [dark_whispers_child.GetFirstName] quietly exits the room, still bloody and in the nude, but not before gently stroking my cheek and smearing the crimson essence of Rose on my face. "It won't be long now. Mother is almost here," she whispers as her body glides past me. I'm left staring at the horrible sight of the bloody cadaver on the bed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Despite the fact that there my own child just murdered someone, all thoughts of the scene slowly start to leave my mind, replaced with the image of my daughter's soft, supple body, her piercing and hypotizing eyes, and her warn red lips that are inching closer and closer to a kiss...\n\n  Just before our lips connect in incestuous passion, [dark_whispers_child.GetFirstName] pushes me back and throws her head up in laughter, breaking me from whatever spell she used to transfix my gaze and mind. She quietly exits the room, still bloody and in the nude, but not before gently stroking my cheek and smearing the crimson essence of Rose on my face. "Mother is coming," she whispers as her body glides past me. "Unfortunately for you, so did I, but perhaps in the future..." I'm left staring at the horrible sight of the bloody cadaver on the bed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeTamsine109TTA;Oh [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], I think I'm going to throw up...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeTamsine111T;Tamsine Irae;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeTamsine111Drow;\n \n  It has been a couple of years since that fateful night when I discovered my child had outright murdered Rose, though she was quick to correct me whenever I brought it up as a willing sacrifice.\n\n  Lately, however, she has taken to being reclusive, staying in her room to study, only coming out when she needs something. What's more surprising is that sometimes, when I spy into her room on occasion, I hear two women talking even though it's just her alone. She is still obsessed with this 'Mother' thing, and I can do nothing but watch from afar and await the coming of whoever or whatever this 'Mother' is.\n\n One night changed all that. In my daughter's bedroom was not the girl I had raised, but a diffent woman. Still a dark elf, still as beautiful as my own flesh and blood, but there was something about her that was different... the eyes glowing red, the wisps of dark smoke surrounding her body, the way she sneered at me as I entered the room... This was no daughter of mine, and yet her body was the exact same.\n\n "Tamsine Irae," the woman spoke dismissively toward me, almost as if she was treating me as a lowly vassal. Tamsine? Did my daughter take a new name? "Your daughter was a fine vessel from which my soul was reborn again." She inspects her arms and body, as if the body was foreign to her. "Soon I will reshape the world in my image, as is fitting of the TRUE House Irae, not like that pathetic 'House' my idiot daughter runs."\n\n Her lithe body glides up to me, and I'm left frozen out of an unnatural fear. Her hands clasp both my cheeks and she looks into my eyes with the most menacing glare I have ever witnessed. "The world will be bathed in blood. Only those who are worthy will survive the storm." Her fingernails rake across my skin and she pulls back, causing deep cuts. "As a reward for fostering my vessel," she continues, stopping only to lap up my blood upon her fingers, "I will kill you last."\n\n And with that, she is gone, disappearing in the black smoke surrounding her body.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

What's more surprising is that sometimes, when I spy into her room on occasion, I hear two women talking even though it's just her alone. She is still obsessed with this 'Mother' thing, and I can do nothing but watch from afar and await the coming of whoever or whatever this 'Mother' is.\n\n One night changed all that. In my daughter's bedroom was not the girl I had raised, but a diffent woman. Still a dark elf, still as beautiful as my own flesh and blood, but there was something about her that was different... the eyes glowing red, the wisps of dark smoke surrounding her body, the way she sneered at me as I entered the room... This was no daughter of mine, and yet her body was the exact same.\n\n "Tamsine Irae," the woman spoke dismissively toward me, almost as if she was treating me as a lowly vassal. Tamsine? Did my daughter take a new name? "Dosst dalharil zhahus natha ula vrekhtasti dal vel'bolen ussta quortek zhahus rosin 'sohna." She inspects her arms and body, as if the body was foreign to her. "Ulnin Usstan orn heeth l'tresk'ri wun ussta zigh, 'zil zhah fek'elen d'l'SEKE Qu'ellar Irae, naut saph nindel yeunn 'Qu'ellar' ussta mal'ai dalharil snur."\n\n Her lithe body glides up to me, and I'm left frozen out of an unnatural fear. Her hands clasp both my cheeks and she looks into my eyes with the most menacing glare I have ever witnessed. "L'tresk'ri orn tlu bri wun vlos. Er'griff nindyn vel'uss ph'khurzon orn dro'xun l'maral." Her fingernails rake across my skin and she pulls back, causing deep cuts. "Zil natha yulul whol kyorlin ussta vrekhtasti," she continues, stopping only to lap up my blood upon her fingers, "Usstan orn elgg dos vaen."\n\n And with that, she is gone, disappearing in the black smoke surrounding her body. I couldn't understand a word she said, but I clearly understood her meaning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeTamsine111TTA;The crisis has begun...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeTamsine200T;The First Irae;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeTamsine200;\n \n  The Matron Mother has heard my plea for aid, and is apparently just as concerned about Tamsine, for she has sent me an army.\n\n  The force consists of freed slaves and surface-dwelling dark elves. Leading the army is a dark elven woman, armored from neck to toe in shining steel and wielding a bastard sword. The marching army halts with a single wordless command by her.\n\n  "I am Kaenia Irae, The First Irae," the woman confidently speaks as she walks up and regards me with a nod. "My little sister would never have asked for me unless the situation is dire." I explain to her about Tamsine and the growing army she has, conquering everything in her path. Kaenia just snorts dismissively. "Mother always was one for the dramatic entrances."\n\n  The warrior woman takes out a crescent moon necklace from underneath her breastplate and clutches it tight in hand before kneeling down and whispering a prayer. After a moment, she stands and nods to me. "I am a Chosen of Eilistraee, and it is my duty to rid the world of my mother. I pledge my aid to you for as long as she is alive. You will have my army and my sword. Use them well.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

HouseIraeTamsine302Suicide;\n \n  Word has reached you of glorious news! Tamsine Irae has been found dead, apparently by her own hand. With no lands left and her previously-loyal army now long-since deserted, the resurrected Tamsine was left with no choice but to commit suicide rather than face her children in defeat.\n\n  While the world that was previously underneath her heel may be broken and shattered, everyone can breathe a sigh of relief as the crisis is now over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeTamsine302Death;\n \n  Word has reached you of glorious news! Tamsine Irae has been killed. Some say she overestimated her abilities and charged directly into a hail of arrows.
