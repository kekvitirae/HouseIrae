# Waterlily arrives with a warning
Laela11T;The Broken Girl;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Laela11LaelaKnown;\n \n  You are about to retire for the night when a loud commotion outside forces you back to your throne room. The guards escort to you a young elven girl, probably no older than sixteen summers, clothed in only a worn cloak. Before you ask why she is not properly dressed, the girl weakly lets out "They... they killed them all..." Only now do you realize that this girl has been greatly traumatized. You wave off the guards.\n  You ask for details, but the girl's gaze doesn't meet yours. It is clear that she has been repeated raped, and her mind and spirit are broken. "They came... violated all the women while the men were forced to watch... Then they..." Her words are cut off as she chokes back tears. "I watched them slit my beloved's throat."\n  "After they were done with me, they... left me alive..." While the girl wipes away a tear, an advisor whispers into your ear, "Likely to serve as a message." You ask who did this. The girl answers only by opening her cloak, exposing her scarred body, and showing you a recently-tattooed symbol of a red hourglass on her thigh. The emblem of black widow spider. Inside the hourglass are the words "Laela Irae."\n  Irae. A name you are very familiar with, but the worst part is recognizing the first half... You order your guards to take the girl and give her food, shelter, and a Serpent's Purge potion before hurrying to your treasury. The dark tome containing the genealogy of the Irae family, gifted generously by the Matron Mother herself, contains the answer you seek: Laela Irae, younger sister to the current Matron Mother. Disappeared under mysterious circumstances involving succession. It appears the woman is back and likely looking for vengeance, or worse... an outlet for her wrath.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

It is likely one of Kekvit's many daughters performing some slave raids on the surface. You order your guards to take the girl and give her food, shelter, and a Serpent's Purge potion while you contemplate why House Irae would so brazenly operate in the open.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

You order your guards to take the girl and give her food, shelter, and a Serpent's Purge potion before you retire to bed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Laela11Question;Send a letter to the Matron demanding answers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# House Irae's response
Laela13Support;I regret to inform you that the Matron Mother is not concerned with such rumors of a pretender. However, as she holds you in high favor, the Matron has sent a package of gold for you for you to use as you see fit in dealing with any slavers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Laela13TSupport;"Not the kind of support I need, but...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Laela13Nothing;I regret to inform you that the Matron Mother is not concerned with such rumors of a pretender. If you are so desperate as to ask for support from the great House Irae to deal with simple slavers, I suggest you grow a pair.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Laela13TNothing;"That bitch!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# House Irae is insulted
Laela14;The Matron Mother feels deeply insulted that you would even suggest we would venture into the filthy surface world to get slaves. Be lucky that she still sees value in you. My brother's blade has gone long without spilling blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Laela14T;"I'm not convinced.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Laela Irae rises
Laela15Lily;\n \n  It has been two years since Waterlily came to court, warning of a growing menace. These past two years, however, have been quiet. With the exception of opportunistic raiding parties, you have heard hide nor hair of any dark elven army, nor of this Laela Irae. At the very least, Lily- as some of the men have taken to calling her- has been keeping herself busy.\n  Just as you are about to settle in for the night's meal with your court favorites, one of your scouts bursts into the room, looking like he sprinted the entire day. "My [Root.GetLordLady]," he says between breaths, "a large dark elven army is gathering, led by the one they call Laela Irae!"\n  The noise of the dinner guests fill the room, ranging from hushed whispers, gasps, and outright laughter. Only one is silent: your ever faithful companion, Lily. You can clearly see she is shaking in a mixture of fear and anger. You silence the room with just a wave of your hand. "Where are they heading?" you ask the scout. "Unknown," he replies. "But camp and and supply train size suggests they number several thousand strong."\n  You dismiss your court and order your marshal to the war room. If Laela wants a war, she wont catch you by surprise. As you leave the room, you turn back and see only one figure left at the table. Lily hasn't moved from her spot, still frozen in fear. What she needs right now is a friend to comfort her, but what your realm needs right now is planning and protection. You make the hard choice and close the door behind you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# House Laela created
Laela7;\n \n  Disturbing news is reported to you. It seems the dark elven upstart, Laela Irae, has took her army and conquered her target. The population of the towns and castles have either been slaughtered or enslaved, leaving nothing but a burning husk of a province behind them. Those that have been enslaved to the dark mistress are being moved to the newly-built underground tunnels.\n  Bolstered by the news, or maybe just out of fear, men and women from neighboring lands are pledging their service to the conquerer, being promised a life of luxury if they would only serve. The scouts who survived report that Laela Irae's army grows stronger, and that her ambitions aren't kept to just that duchy.\n  Banners of the new nation, "House Laela", can be seen in her armies. It is clear that this is not going to be a peaceful transition. Laela's eyes are already gazing across to her neighbors. Your scouts also report that this new Matron Mother has a cadre of trained bodyguards and assassins by her side at all times, and her longevity is the stuff of legends. It seems the only way to survive is through force on the battlefield, or through submission.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Laela7TT2;"This does not bode well...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Waterlily gets picked as Eilistaee's Chosen
Laela16;\n \n  It has been several years since Waterlily came to you, a broken shell of her former self. In those years, she has dedicated her time to studying with the priests and tending to the sick and wounded in both the hospitals and the war camps. Her resolve to serve Eilistraee keeps the girl strong and mentally sound. She has since become a trusted voice of reason, traveling with you in times of peace and war, and today is no different. Standing across the battlefield before the forces of House Laela, with Lily by your side, you contemplate just how many of your forces will survive this battle, if any.\n  Your little Lily, on the other hand, isn't so stoic. You can see the anger and rage building up in her face as she surveys the dark elven forces before her. The ones carrying the same banner as those who sacked her village those years ago. Her fingers grip her walking stick so hard that the flesh goes deathly white. The girl mutters a prayer to her Moonlight Goddess under her breath, and without further hesitation launches herself at the enemy with blinding speed. As you are about to call out to her to return to your side, the world around darkens. Day turns into night in just a few short seconds, with a bright crescent moon- larger than any you've ever seen before- illuminating the battlefield, and most importantly Waterlily.\n  The girl you once knew is no more. Once simple rags turn into shining steel armor, and her walking stick changes into a flaming bastard sword, the fires of which flare up with each dark elf the girl strikes down. But the most striking surprising transformation of all is that Lily has grown angelic wings, with which she uses to great ability as she swoops and dives against the enemy over and over again.\n  You order your troops to charge forward to assist the new battle maiden. But something doesn't feel right. You could have sworn your army was much smaller before...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Laela16T;Eilistaee's Chosen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Laela16TLolth;"That bitch goddess has a use after all...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Laela16TNotSeldarine;"It's a miracle! CHARGE!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Fall of the House of Laela
Laela18;\n \n  News reports have come in that the House Laela mistress, Laela Irae, has fallen. Be it from a slip up in battle or some other cause is irrelevant. The Matron is dead, and the world can breathe a sigh of relief. Without their leadership inspiring or torturing them, the remaining House Laela members quickly disband, left to their own personal ambitions. While it will be some time before the stragglers are mopped up, the world is safe from the ambitions of a crazed dark elven woman.\n\n\n\n  You have this strange feeling that someone, somewhere in the dark, is celebrating the news of the Fall of House Laela.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Waterlily's purpose is fulfilled
Laela19Eilistraee;\n \n  It has been two weeks since news of Laela Irae's death, and since then your battle maiden, Waterlily, has calmed down significantly. Once, she was a powerful Angel of Death, leading her troops to victory after victory, but today it seems as if she never transformed. Once was there shining steel platemail, now there are the simple robes of a priestess. Once was there a bastard sword made of fire, now there are only books and herbal mixtures. Even her wings are gone.\n  Tonight, however, Lily brazenly sneaks into your bedroom. Her small frame, covered by a large cloak, is illuminated only by the window's moonlight. "My [From.GetLordLady]," she speaks before you demand answers for this intrusion. "Remember that day on the battlefield?" Lately, she never speaks unless she has something important to say, so you nod your head in reply. "I prayed to Eilistraee for vengeance. The Dark Maiden normally abhores violence, and made a pact with me to grant me what I desired."\n  Lily removes her cloak, revealing her nude body to you. The red hourglass tattoo, something she has long since abhored, is missing. You raise your eyebrow and begin to ask what she is doing when Waterlily cuts you off. "Eilistraee demanded my life end soon after I got what I wanted. Tonight, I will praise the Dark Maiden with one last dance before I die." The girl starts twirling around the room, in an almost hypnotic manner. "Dance with me," she asks. Because of your faith, you know this dance is one of the most revered of all of Eilistraee's rituals. You could do no less but to join.\n  The two of you dance for what seems like hours, nude, in your bedroom, illuminated only by the moonlight outside. And yet, it feels natural, safe, comforting. At long last, Waterlily's dance has come to an end. She speaks no words, but her face tells you everything you need to know. A smile crosses Lily's face, something you haven't seen in years. She then slumps to her knees and down to the ground.\n  Waterlily is gone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Laela221T;Influx of Slaves;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Laela221;\n \n  After your recent victory, your troops have their way with the local peasantry. Looting and rape run rampant. Eventually you grow tired of the distraction and order the strongest survivors to be enslaved, branded, and conscripted into your army.\n  As per the vassalage contract with your wife, you send a majority of the slaves to Laela for her to command personally and keep the rest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Laela221TT;"My army grows, but so does hers...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Laela23NoLily;\n \n In the growing weeks, you have seen the Spurned Sister grow her empire, province by province. And now Laela's lands border your own, and you are certain that she will target you next. Just as you are about to convene your war council, a dark elven messenger- bearing a black cloak with a red hourglass symbol- comes to your court.\n  "My [Root.GetLordLady], the Dark Mistress wishes to give you this," he says, handing over a sealed letter. The letter itself smells faintly of perfume and sex, and the scent is almost intoxicating. Shaking off the feeling, you quickly open the letter to find but a few words, written in blood.\n\n          We have much to discuss.\n          Come into my parlor.\n\n  Rather than a written signature, the letter is signed with a red lipstick mark. The messenger awaits your answer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Laela24T;Laela's Tent;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Laela24Female;\n \n  You are escorted into House Laela's war camp and to her own personal tent. Inside, you find the woman herself, Laela Irae- dressed in what could barely be considered sleepwear- lounging on a large sofa. The fabric of the pillows alone could be worth a barony. For everything you've heard of the dark elf, it seems her size is an exaggeration. The woman, you estimate, is only five feet tall, if that. "So, you've come at last," she lazily says, sipping on a glass of what looks to be blood. She dismisses her guards, leaving the two of you alone, before stretching her legs and standing up, wine glass still in hand. The dark elf slides toward you until only mere inches separate the two of you. "My, what a fine specimen," Laela comments, running her free hand up the front of your bodice to grope your clothed breasts.\n  While her touch is a bit comforting and her perfume is intoxicating, your own particular sexual orientation doesn't cause any reaction. Laela senses this and frowns. "Not into women, are you?" she queries before getting a sly smirk on her face. She tosses aside the wine glass and, in the blink of an eye, both her hands glow blue with magical energy, with which she forcefully grabs both a breast and your crotch over your clothes. It only takes a moment, but you can feel your nipples harden and your pussy getting wet. Your mind no longer sees Laela as just another woman, but as an object of desire. "See?" the dark elf comments, taking her hands back off of you, the blue energies dissipating. "All you needed was a little convincing."\n  Laela goes back to lounging on her sofa, with her eyes staring intently at you as you try to struggle with your new found desires. "We have much to discuss, my little pet. But first... I desire a woman's touch for tonight.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

"My, what a fine specimen," Laela comments, running her free hand up the front of your bodice to grope your clothed breasts.\n  While her touch is a bit comforting and her perfume is intoxicating, your own particular sexual orientation doesn't cause any reaction. Laela senses this and frowns. "Not into women, are you?" she queries before getting a sly smirk on her face. She tosses aside the wine glass and, in the blink of an eye, both her hands glow blue with magical energy, with which she forcefully grabs both a breast and your crotch over your clothes. It only takes a moment, but you can feel your nipples harden and your pussy getting wet. Your mind no longer sees Laela as just another woman, but as an object of desire. "See?" the dark elf comments, taking her hands back off of you, the blue energies dissipating. "All you needed was a little convincing."\n  Laela goes back to lounging on her sofa, with her eyes staring intently at you as you try to struggle with your new found desires. "We have much to discuss, my little pet. But first... I desire a woman's touch for tonight.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Laela25GMale;\n \n  You are escorted into House Laela's war camp and to her own personal tent. Inside, you find the woman herself, Laela Irae- dressed in what could barely be considered sleepwear- lounging on a large sofa. The fabric of the pillows alone could be worth a barony. For everything you've heard of the dark elf, it seems her size is an exaggeration. The woman, you estimate, is only five feet tall, if that. "So, you've come at last," she lazily says, sipping on a glass of what looks to be blood. She dismisses her guards, leaving the two of you alone, before stretching her legs and standing up, wine glass still in hand.

Laela29Female;\n \n  It's not long before the overwhelming scent coming from the woman completely overrides any last vestiges of mental freedom, and you soon advance upon the woman, pinning her down onto the sofa and ripping off what little clothes she has. Your advances are halted as Laela forcefully commands, "No. You are MY pet, not the other way around." She grabs you by the throat and twists you around until you are on your back, with the woman on top of you, straddling your legs. "There, all my pets deserve to be under a domineering woman." Your mind is already too far gone to protest.\n  A wave of her hand, and you feel something penetrating your depths. Looking down, you see she has conjured a toy... a realistic feeling cock, double-ended that pierces both you and her. "You and me are going to have a lot of fun," Laela growls into your ear. Both you and Laela are fucking the toy, and waves of pleasure rip through your body each time the woman bounces up and down. "This little thing is realistic is more than one way," she whispers, and soon you find out why... the cockend that pierces you releases a jet of seed into your womb. "You will have my child." Again, you are too mentally broken to care, much less protest. All you desire is your Dark Mistress dominating your body.\n  Hours pass like a lifetime, and eventually both you and your lover are too tired to continue. You see the morning sun's rays peeking in through the tent flaps. Her scent is gone... replaced only with the heavy smell of sex, and with it your mental facilities. "I like you," Laela comments, running a finger lazily down your body. "Be my consort, and I will give you everything you so desire. All I ask is for your vassalage." She stands up off the sofa and shoves her foot onto your chest. "Kiss my feet, and receive my blessing. Refuse, and I will let you live..." Her hand starts glowing a deep purple, surrounded by magical energy. "...but not without punishment.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Laela27;\n \n  "Excellent," Laela cackles as you bend down to kiss her feet. "Now you will know true power. Together, we will rule this gods-forsaken world." The woman pulls you to your feet and places a slow kiss on your lips. Despite being a gesture of your new marriage, the kiss feels unloving. To Laela, you are merely a slave to her whims.\n  "Oh," she comments, remembering something. "I have one last gift for you. That little elven slut? She was taken by the guards sometime during the night. You will find her outside."\n\n  Stepping out of the tent with your new mistress and wife, you find Waterlily. Or, rather, the corpse of Waterlily, laying on the floor, bloodied, broken, and covered in semen. "I had no use for her, so I gave her to my guards." Laela nonchalantly comments. "It appears they were a little too rough." She shrugs and gives the dead body a swift kick. "Whatever.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

She knew you wouldn't abandon her, and now, with a simple nod, her faith in you was justified.\n  Your angelic guardian springs forward, her flaming bastard sword materializing in her hand, and impales Laela through the chest from behind. The dark elf crumbles to the ground as Lily removes her sword. You take the opportunity to gather back up your clothes and flash a quick smile to your little elven angel.\n  Before you two can celebrate, the body of Laela is surrounded by a deep purple mist. The magical energy around the woman feels very malignant, and neither you nor Lily have any desire to stay to find out what happens next. You still need to get out of her war camp safely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

To Laela, you are merely a slave to her whims.\n  Waterlily seethes with anger at this betrayal. She knew you had a plan. That is why she stayed by all night, even through her anger and rage, even through the moans coming from your mouth. She knew you wouldn't abandon her, and now, with a simple kiss, her faith in you was fatally misplaced.\n  Waterlily surges forward with a scream, her flaming bastard sword materializing in her hand. Laela, ever mindful of the vengeful angel, sidesteps the attacker easily. But Laela was not Lily's target... and you soon find out that fact as the elven angel thrusts her sword deep into your chest.\n  As blood flows from your mouth, you stare down the angel. Her gaze meets yours, and you see only hatred. Laela waves her hand and Waterlily bursts into flames, the girl's screams of agony and pain ringing through your ears.\n  The last thing you see before oblivion takes you is Laela standing over your body. "What a shame," she says as the world fades to black. "Maybe the next one will survive longer.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Before you is a woman... if you could call her that. Her upper body is that of a beautiful dark elf, and yet her lower body is that of a black widow spider. "Bow before me, give me praise, and you will return to your new... wife." Lolth, the Spider Queen. Your will to live forces you to bow.\n  You open your eyes to see the wound is gone, and Laela kneeling before you, malignant mists of purple surrounding her hand. "My favorite pet won't get away from me that easily," the woman spits out with a sneer. Looking down, you see a pile of bone and ash. Your would-be killer was easily dealt with by your Dark Mistress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
