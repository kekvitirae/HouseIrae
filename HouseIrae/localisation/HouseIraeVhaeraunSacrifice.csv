HouseIraeVhaeraunSacrifice1;\n \n  I can feel that the time is right to honor the Masked Lord. I notify my court and vassals of the ritual, and of their expected participation.\n  While I do encourage attendance, I do recognize that some may have conflicts that prevent their attendance. These individuals though are expected to then pay tribute. Those that do not attend and do not pay tribute risk my wrath and that of Vhaeraun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

HouseIraeVhaeraunSacrifice7;\n \n  The time of sacrifice is upon us. A sacrifice will be tied down and stabbed through the heart with a dagger. The blood will flow like wine at a party.\n  Vhaeraun favors both prisoners and slaves.
