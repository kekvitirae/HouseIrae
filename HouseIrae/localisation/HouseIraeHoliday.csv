HouseIraeHoliday1T;A Gift From House Irae;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeHoliday1Christmas;A dark elven woman appears before you in court in the middle of the annual Christmas feast. Dressed elegantly and walking with a confident gait, it is clear that this woman is of importance, but it doesn't dawn on you until she strides up to you and hands you a wax-sealed letter: It's the Matron Mother of House Irae herself! With all haste, you open the letter and examine the contents.\n\n\n     Christmas is such a weird tradition for you Christian types.\n     Decorating a dead tree. Giving coal to bad children instead of putting them to the blade. Believing in some fat bastard who gorges on pastries and milk all night.\n     Still, you have done right by me, and have certainly earned my favor. For this, I'm giving you a little Christmas gift: Me.\n     Or, more accurately, a clone of myself. I am an accomplished freshcrafter, and this clone is a product of my magic. Feel free to use her for anything. And I do mean anything.\n\n     Aluve,\n     -Kekvit Irae, Matron Mother, House Irae\n\nI stare at the clone, whom simply watches for any reaction, silently judging me. This is going to be an interesting night...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
