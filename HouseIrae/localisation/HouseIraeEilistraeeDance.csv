houseirae_eilistraee_dance_ritual_desc;Eilistraee's most sacred ritual involves dancing in the nude under the waxing moon in a grand ceremony. The entire ritual will take two weeks, during which the dancer is expected to perform from sundown to sunrise with only a few hours of rest and prayer at midnight. Despite being a champion of equality, Eilistraee decrees that this one ritual be performed only by women. Such a grand event can only be held once every 15 years by a single character.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

HouseIraeEilistraeeDance1;\n \n  I can feel the new noon is waning and the full foon is returning. Many of the young yathrin are eager to strip bare and attend their first Moonlight Dance to honor the Dark Maiden. I notify my court and vassals of the ritual, and of their expected participation.\n  While I do encourage attendance, I do recognize that some may have conflicts that prevent their attendance. These individuals though are expected to then pay tribute.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeEilistraeeDance1TT;May Eilistraee bless us as we honor her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

HouseIraeEilistraeeDance2;I have been summoned to take part in the sacred Moonlight Dance to Eilistraee.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeEilistraeeDance2TT;I shall attend the ritual!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

HouseIraeEilistraeeDance3;I have been summoned to take part in the sacred Moonlight Dance to Eilistraee. I will not go for variety of reasons. As is custom, I am expected to pay a small tribute for not attending.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

HouseIraeEilistraeeDance5;\n \n  [From.GetBestName] has declined to attend, and has insulted me by refusing to pay tribute for their absence.

HouseIraeEilistraeeDance5TT;[From.GetFirstName] will not be attending the ceremony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

HouseIraeEilistraeeDance6Straight;\n \n  The sun has set, the bonfire lit, and the moon is high. I order the yathrin to discard their clothes, pick up a sword, and start the ritualistic dance. The more experienced women do so without question, though a few of the younger women hesitate. This is obviously their first time at a Moonlight Dance. Some are blushing furiously, their nipples hardening. Others still are trying to protect their modesty with their hands and swords. I remind those who hesitate that this is merely a ceremony to honor Eilistraee, not an orgy and not a time to gawk.\n  Hours pass, and the new-comers are now getting much more used to the nudity and the flailing bodies, though their dancing form is still unrefined. This continues for several days, with everyone taking a break every midnight for an hour to retreat back to the nearby dormitory for a nap, prayer, or... comfort. What they do in this hour is none of my concern. They have earned the time off, and Eilistraee smiles each time we return to the bonfire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The sight of swaying breasts and the smooth figures forces me to say more than one prayer to Eilistraee for guidance and help.\n  Hours pass, and the new-comers are now getting much more used to the nudity and the flailing bodies, though their dancing form is still unrefined.

HouseIraeEilistraeeDance7T;The Shy Dancer;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeEilistraeeDance7;\n \n  A week has passed, and the festivities are not over yet. Though we dance from sundown to sunrise, save for an hour's break, Eilistraee invigorates each dancer with magical energy to keep us fit and able-minded during the day. Each night, I volunteer during the hour of rest to patrol the grounds for any hostiles which may be lurking nearby, clothed in a yathrin's robe and carrying a sword for protection.\n  On one particular night, I spot a dark elven woman in a far away glade, hidden from the sight of the festivities. She, too, is performing the sacred ritual, but something is off... the woman is clothed, though 'clothed' might be an overstatement. The girl is wearing just the bare minimum of shawls and panties to cover her modesty. She has yet to spot me, and I take a few moments to size her up as a threat, as no true Eilistraee follower would ever insult the Dark Maiden by performing the Moonlight Dance in clothes.\n  Wisps of fairyfire float about her as she dances, illuminating the glade around her. As I watch, I note that there is one flaw with the woman (besides the garments)... the girl's dancing form is amateurish at best. She occasionally stumbles or trips over herself. After a few minutes of watching her, the girl trips and tumbles to the ground. She does not get back up, and starts to cry, apparently ashamed of her own lack of skill in the sight of the Dark Maiden.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeEilistraeeDance7TTA;That poor thing... I must help her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeEilistraeeDance7TTB;She will need to learn on her own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

HouseIraeEilistraeeDance71;\n \n  The girl hasn't spotted me yet as I step into the grove and into the magical illumination. She is fixated on prostrating herself toward the full moon and crying. I can hear her whisper things like "Forgive me, Dark Maiden." The girl is startled and crawls back away from me as I clear my throat to catch her attention. The dark elven woman tries desperately to cover herself as she looks up at me in fear. I simply kneel down and offer a hand to the woman, asking what her name is. "V-V-Vala," she weakly gets out. "Vala Sael." It is clear to me that she is extremely shy around others, which is why I have never seen her at the festivities. Vala cautiously takes my hand and pulls herself to her feet, but her face is flushed purple from embarrassment as she looks away from my body. Another reason why she hasn't joined in with the others...\n  I offer my help with her footwork. Despite her shyness, Vala is extremely eager to learn. Her dedication to Eilistraee is admirable, just not her techniques. Over the next few nights, we dance together, away from the group and in the same grove, illuminated by the fairyfire. A magical trick she learned as a child, she mentions. Eventually, she becomes much more used to my presence, and on the final night sheds the last remnents of her clothes. The transformation is almost magical... once nude, Vala goes from a bumbling fool to a dancer with skill rivaling a yathtallar.\n  The night comes to a close, and with it the ceremony. Vala finishes redressing herself and stares at my still-nude body. A look of half-apprehension half-lust comes over her eyes as she bites down on her lip, deciding if she wants to stay with you or move on with her life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

HouseIraeEilistraeeDance8Straight;\n \n  A week has passed, and the festivities are not over yet. Though we dance from sundown to sunrise, save for an hour's break, Eilistraee invigorates each dancer with magical energy to keep us fit and able-minded during the day. Each night, I volunteer during the hour of rest to patrol the grounds for any hostiles which may be lurking nearby, clothed in a yathrin's robe and carrying a sword for protection.\n  On one particular night, I spot a dark elven woman in a far away glade, hidden from the sight of the festivities. She is completely nude, sitting on the side of a pond and playing a simple tune on a lyre, oblivious to her surroundings. The woman is beautiful... stunning... even by dark elven standards. I take a few moments to size her up as a threat to the festivities, when she suddenly stops playing and speaks out loud, "Are you going to join me, or are you just going to gawk, child?" She knows of my presence, but she doesn't turn her head toward me. The woman is unarmed, so I decide to throw caution into the wind and step out into the moonlit glade.\n  "I have been watching you ever since the Moonlight Dance started," the woman casually says, cracking a smile on her lips. I ask why she hasn't participated. "You know full well why," she replies. I cock my head in confusion, not understanding what she meant. The woman answers my confusion by strumming her fingers across her lyre. "Stay awhile and listen to a story of mine. I haven't spoken to anyone in many years, and I am so very lonely."\n  I look up at the full moon and make a mental note that the hour of rest is almost over. The yathrin will certainly wonder where I've been if I stay with the woman. I bite my lip and make a decision...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Sighing, I look up at the full moon and make a mental note that the hour of rest is almost over. The yathrin will certainly wonder where I've been if I stay with the woman. I bite my lip and make a decision...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeEilistraeeDance8TTA;(stay and listen to her story, missing the night's dancing);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeEilistraeeDance8TTB;(apologize and return to the festival);;;;;;;;;;;;;x

HouseIraeEilistraeeDance81;\n \n  The yathrin will understand if I miss a single night of dancing. After all, this dark elf has stated that she hasn't had a companion in years. There are seven more nights of festivities, but only one night where I will spend in good company with this stranger. The choice is obvious. I slide up to the beautiful woman and sit down at the edge of the pond next to her, dipping my toes in the surprisingly-warm water.\n  "I'm an exile of my people," she speaks, strumming her lyre casually. "I was born to loving parents. My father was a good and kind ruler, and my mother his consort." The woman's face lights up in a warm smile, as if remembering good days... before the smile disappears into a glare. "One day, when I was just a young adult, a host of evil attacked my home. It was then that my mother showed her true colors." Her glare becomes more and more pronounced, almost seething in anger. "She betrayed my father... almost killed him... before retreating to the host's camp. She took with her many like-minded followers. Though I was innocent, I thought that I could sway some of her host back into the light, and so I exiled myself with my mother." The dark elf snorts before continuing, "Father never forgave me. I probably wouldn't either."\n  The woman shrugs and waves her hand dismissively. "Had I been stronger, I might have saved my people." She turns and looks me up and down, appraising me for something. "You, on the other hand, can still protect your own people. I can help you." Her free hand opens and a bastard sword materializes from thin air. "Take this," she says, handing the sword over to me. It is fairly mundane in construction, but the moment it enters my hand I feel... invigorated. "Now dance," the woman commands, before strumming a light tune on her lyre. As if compulsed, I throw off my robe and step into the pond, beginning my dance. My movements are as fluid as the water I am dancing in. The night passes quickly, and by sunrise I finish the dance. The woman is gone, vanished, as is the sword, but I can still feel her presence...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeEilistraeeDance81TT;"Who was that woman?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

HouseIraeEilistraeeDance11;\n \n  The final night of the Moonlight Dance has finally passed, and with the rising sun I, and all the yathrin who attended, prostrate ourselves to the waxing moon, asking for blessings, forgiveness, strength, or whatever else is on our minds. Though our sacred duty is never complete, today, at least, is a day of rest and celebration. Just as the sun peeks out from over the horizon, I can feel the Dark Maiden smiling down upon us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
