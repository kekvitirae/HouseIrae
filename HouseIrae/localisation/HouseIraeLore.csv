HouseIraeLore2T;The Dark Seldarine;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeLore2;The Dark Seldarine is the collective name given to the pantheon of dark elven gods. While one does not need to be a dark elf to worship them, most Dark Seldarine gods look down on the 'lesser' races, some will view them as beneath their notice, with even fewer still willing to embrace other races.\n\n  In the House Irae mod, only three gods are present in the game mechanics... Lolth, Vhaeraun, and Eilistraee.\n  In total, there are nine gods in the pantheon, though Lolth's control of information means that very little information about any god other than herself is either wildly inaccurate or extremely hard to find.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

HouseIraeLore21T;Lolth, the Spider Queen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeLore21;Lolth is the uncontested ruler of the Dark Seldarine. Her avatar is in the shape of a spider with the upper body of a dark elven woman. If there was any god that epitomizes the dark elf race as a whole, it would be Lolth. She is cruel, violent, uncaring, devious, and extremely evil. Nearly all dark elves are taught at a young age to emulate the Spider Queen. As a result, dark elven society is extremely chaotic, with only the strongest coming to power and subjugating the rest... at least until they, themselves, are subjugated or killed.\n  Lolth used to be the main consort of Corellion Larethian, the leader of the Seldarine- the pantheon of the surface elves- under the name of Araushnee. Araushnee had three children. She was extremely ambitious, and when the time was right, she struck out in betrayal toward her husband and fellow Seldarine gods. Araushnee ultimately failed to kill her husband, and was cursed with the body of a demon spider and cast out into the Abyss, eventually changing her name to Lolth. Vhaeraun and Eilistraee joined their mother in exile, while Vandria was the only child of hers who refused to leave her father's side.\n  Today, Lolth seethes with hatred over all races, even the dark elves who were exiled with her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

HouseIraeLore22T;Vhaeraun, The Masked Lord;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeLore22;Vhaeraun is the son of Lolth, and the only one in the Seldarine who actively and publicly contests Lolth's power and matriarchal society. At times, Lolth even encourages this conflict, as it fuels her love for internal conflict and chaos. That encouragement stops when Vhaeraun starts to sway Lolth's followers to his side.\n  Vhaeraun is the dark elven deity of thievery, arrogance, and- most importantly- dark elven males. His avatar takes the form of a dark elven man wearing a mask at all times. Some suggest he is hiding the scars inflicted by his mother for his arrogance.\n  Vhaeraun was exiled by his father for his part in Araushnee's rebellion, though fared better than his mother, whom was changed into a demon and cast into the Abyss.\n\nFor gameplay purposes, Vhaeraun in House Irae differs from the original Vhaeraun in the Dungeons & Dragons Forgotten Realms setting. In House Irae, Vhaeraun is extremely partiarchal, the opposite of his mother. In Forgotten Realms, Vhaeraun is a champion of equality among his followers, seeing no difference between men or women, so long as they serve him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

HouseIraeLore23T;Eilistraee, The Dark Maiden;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeLore23;Eilistraee is the odd one out in the Dark Seldarine. Her heart is good and kind, a complete opposite of her mother and brother. Also unlike her mother and brother, Eilistraee embraces and welcomes all good-natured followers, regardless of race.\n  The Dark Maiden is the goddess of good dark elves, moonlight, dancing, and song. Her avatar appears as a beautiful dark elven woman, completely nude with white hair down to her ankles, and wielding her signature bastard sword.\n  Despite Eilistraee being cleared of all wrong-doing during her mother's rebellion, she still chose the path of exile in hopes of protecting those dark elves who might be persecuted for simply being born with dark skin and white hair. She actively fights against Lolth, though not to the extent of Vhaeraun. Lolth, too, does not grant her the same bemused encouragement that she does with the elder brother, seeing her daughter as a failure of her bloodline.\n\nFor gameplay purposes, Eilistraee in House Irae differs from the original Eilistraee in the Dungeons & Dragons Forgotten Realms setting. In House Irae, Eilistraee is the champion of equality, seeing no difference between men and woman. However, in Forgotten Realms, Eilistraee still maintains the matriarchal social structure of the dark elves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

HouseIraeLore3T;The Dark Elves;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeLore3;Dark elves have many names for themselves depending on the setting. Examples include the svartalfs for the Norse, duskwights for Final Fantasy XIV, and drow for their original appearance in Dungeons & Dragons. For the purposes of House Irae, the name 'dark elves' is used, though the mod itself is based off of the drow of Forgotten Realms.\n\n  Dark elves stand around the same height as average humans, but shorter than surface elves. Some exceptional dark elves rise to six and a half feet high, while some unlucky ones barely reach any taller than five feet in height. Four main features distinguish a dark elf... first is the obvious pointed elven ears. Depending on the culture and genetics, these may either point up or point out to the side. Second is the pure white hair. No other elven race can produce white hair, except half-dark elves. Third, dark elves have a wide variety of eye colors. Ranging from green to blue to purple to deep red, dark elven eyes are more often than not of the exotic variety. Finally, their skin color is what gives them their name. Dark elves can range anywhere from ebony black, to light blue, to chocolate brown. Some rare albino varieties are known to exist, having an extremely pale- almost white- skin tone.\n  Dark elves, much like their surface elf counterparts, can live for centuries. A child becomes an adult at roughly 90 years of age. Due to the limitations of the game, dark elves in House Irae live as long or as short as humans, and mature just as fast. Dark elves also have day-blindness, often choosing to only go out onto the surface during the night to avoid disorientation. Much like their age, this day-blindness is not modeled by the House Irae mod.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

HouseIraeLore31T;Social Structure;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeLore31;Dark elves live underground in the deep, dark tunnels of the underworld. Despite this, dark elven vanity has allowed for grand and majestic cities to be built, often illuminated only by bioluminecent fungus or magical fairyfire. Because they can see nearly-perfectly in total darkness, torches and lamps are rarely required except as vanity items.\n  Despite their extremely volitile and chaotic nature, dark elven society is relatively stable and peaceful, owing to the fear of being assassinated by anyone, even close relatives. There are only two laws in the underground cities... females are superior to males, and murder is illegal. Technically, murder is legal and expected, it's just that getting caught is what's illegal and punishable by death. Dark elves have very few (if any) taboos. Incest is not only allowed, but encouraged. Daughters are expected to take their brothers or father as their first lover. Rape is also commonplace. It is one of the very few times males can show their dominance to females. This is encouraged due to the desire for strong women. If a female dark elf cant resist the unwanted advances of a male, she doesn't deserve her status. Except for incest, none of the above expectations or laws apply to the surface communities of the kind-hearted Eilistraee.\n  Dark elven society is extremely matriarchal. Males can rise in station, but they are still considered almost slaves to the females. Yathrin, the temple priestesses, are one step above most females due to their duties to Lolth. Above the yathrin are the matriarchs, the eldest and strongest woman of each individual House. Above them is the yathtallar, the high priestess. All bow to her... all except the Matron Mother, the ruler of the city. While it is expected to kill above your station to rise to power, few successfully do due to the power gap.\n  Because of their pride and vanity, outsiders (such as humans) are considered less than dark elven males. Outsiders in a dark elf city are expected to finish their business and leave quickly. There are no laws protecting an outsider, and outright murder of an outsider is not illegal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

HouseIraeLore32T;Rivalries;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeLore32;Owing to their evil and chaotic nature, dark elves are the enemies of all sentient life. However, a few races are placed higher on the list of 'most hated enemies.'\n  The surface elves have been the mortal enemies of the dark elves dating back to the time of Lolth's betrayal and exile. Both hate each other, and there is even one Seldarine god who specializes in hunting and killing dark elves. All dark elves are expected to take the head of at least one of their surface-dwelling cousins in their life. If they can enslave them as a sex slave, all the better.\n  Mind flayers, tentacled magic users who use the powers of their mind to the fullest extent, are also natural enemies of the dark elves, if only because both races share the same underworld. Mind flayers see dark elf brains as delicacies and feasts, owing to the natural intelligence of the elven race. Because of this, many dark elves often shield themselves from mental attack whenever they form raiding parties. They never know when they might be stalked by a mind flayer.\n  The greatest threat to dark elves, and the one race they hate above all else... are themselves. Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer. Dark elves who smell even the slightest hint of weakness in a superior will not hesitate to strike. This constant shift of power is how dark elven society, at least in non-Eilistraee communities, stay stable.\n  Special mention needs to be given to the surface communities of Eilistraee's followers. Because they worship a goddess of good, followers of the Dark Maiden are welcomed into normal surface societies more readily than dark elves of other gods. This, however, does not mean that they are fully accepted. In fact, all dark elves, regardless of religion, are viewed with suspicion. At the very least, though, Eilistraee followers are not hunted on sight by the Seldarine and the surface elves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

HouseIraeLore4T;House Irae;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeLore4;Dark elven society is divided among the Houses, powerful (and not so powerful) clans of families that have banded together under a single family name... whether voluntary or not. Each House has a matriarch, but only the strongest House has the Matron Mother, the ruler of dark elven society in that particular city. The current ruling House is House Irae, governed by the Second Irae, Kekvit.\n  House Irae used to be a joke in dark elven society, until a woman by the name of Tamsine rose to the rank of matriarch in the House. Wielding dark magics that are forbidden even in dark elven society, Tamsine quickly dispatched the reigning Matron Mother and set herself up to be the new ruler. It was not long before House Irae was dominant in the city, dwarfing all other rival Houses. Few dared speak out against her foul demonology and witchcraft. Those that did suddenly and mysteriously disappeared. Nobody knows exactly what happened to them, but all knew that Tamsine was to blame, and there was nothing anyone could do about it but kneel before her feet.\n  The city breathed a collective sigh of relief when Tamsine made one fatal error... she let her guard down around the one daughter of hers she thought too weak to usurp her power. For weeks, Tamsine's rotting head was displayed prominently above Kekvit's new throne, to show everyone who 'liberated' the Houses from the influence of the vile Witch Queen. While Kekvit did reform dark elven society to an extent, such as legalizing the worship of other Dark Seldarine gods and allowing rival Houses to have a modicum of power, the new Matron Mother was still very much a dark elf. Kekvit would demand slaves and lovers by the dozens, often killing those who did not satisfy her lusts when the night was over. Few complained, as the deaths of a few slaves and unwanted males did less to harm society than Tamsine's rampant slaughter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

HouseIraeLore41T;The Three Iraes;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeLore41;When Tamsine was just a meager matriarch of a weak and pathetic House Irae, she had prayed to Lolth for strength to overthrow her rivals. The only response she got? The Spider Queen's laughter filling the halls of her mansion for a week. 'Strength must be earned, not given,' remarked the goddess as the week-long laughter faded. Tamsine, unfettered by the insult, instead chose to bargain with a demon lord. He would grant the matriarch everything she wanted, but in return he would place a curse on all those of her bloodline. Despite being heavy with triplets, Tamsine eagerly agreed. After all, power comes before family. If something happened to her unborn children, she could always find another lover and start over.\n  Shortly after dispatching the previous Matron Mother and all threats to her new legitimacy, Tamsine gave birth to three daughters. The dark magic she wielded seeped into her womb, affecting all three girls. At the moment of birth, the demon lord's curse was placed upon the children, but it would be much later in life when said curse would manifest itself.\n  The firstborn, Kaenia, would be Tamsine's favorite, as was custom to all firstborn daughters. The next girl to be born, Kekvit, absorbed more than her fair share of dark magic from the womb. The birthing was surprisingly easy and painless due to the girl's innate abilities, which was unheard of for a child who was just birthed. The final girl was the runt of the litter, being born at nearly half the weight of her sisters. If it wasn't for Laela's innate determination to survive and fight, there would have been only two Irae girls in the family. As the girls grew, they formed close bonds with each other. Kaenia and Kekvit helped each other experiment with love and sex as their bodies developed, and Laela would be the favorite sparring partner of the other two girls. Their close bond broke down when the family curse manifested itself in the girls at the same time... Kaenia prefered being alone, Kekvit prefered the company of men, and Laela viewed the other two as threats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

HouseIraeLore41TTB;Kekvit Irae;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeLore41TTC;Laela Irae;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 

HouseIraeLore51T;Kaenia Irae;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HouseIraeLore51;Kaenia was the first to be born, nicknamed the First Irae by Tamsine to mark the start of her family bloodline after birthing her children mere days after killing the previous Matron. Growing up, the girl had almost unrivaled beauty and intelligence. Tamsine favored her as next in line for the throne, and was trained and tutored accordingly. The curse manifested itself in Kaenia as insanity, and the woman would often be overheard speaking to nobody in particular, or doing something inappropriate in front of the court. When she came of age, Kaenia left House Irae to the surface on self-exile due to her increasingly-frequent bouts of insanity.\n  In reality, however, Kaenia was far more intelligent than her mother gave her credit for. The curse was not insanity, but that of a good and just heart. She was not speaking to nobody in particular, but rather she was speaking directly to Eilistraee, whom was guiding and protecting the girl all throughout her life. She merely deceived her mother and sisters into thinking she was insane to protect her true allegiance. Her current whereabouts are unknown, but rumors suggest that she is never too far from her sisters, silently protecting and guiding them from within the shadows. Perhaps her curse is truly a curse and not a blessing, for she still sees some good in her youngest sister and still hopes that one day Laela might see the light, never once knowing that it is too late for the youngest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 

HouseIraeLore52T;Kekvit Irae;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HouseIraeLore52;Kekvit, the Second Irae, was not her mother's favorite. In fact, she was the worst of the lot in Tamsine's eyes. Seemingly never ambitious, and wanting to grow up to be a great wizard (a task often taken up only by lowly males) rather than be a yathtallar or Matron, Kekvit's curse manifested itself as a near-unquenchable lust. Losing her virginity at a far younger age than what was socially acceptable, Kekvit drew the ire of Tamsine on more than one occasion when she would spend her nights chasing boys rather than spending it on religious studies. Still, the one (and likely only) redeeming quality Kekvit had in her mother's eyes was the girl's affinity for magic. The very first spell she crafted was a contraception spell, which proved useful on more than one occasion.\n  Intelligence certainly ran in the Irae family, as what Tamsine thought was just idle fucking was much more than that to her daughter. The girl made her way into the hearts and minds of many of the males she bedded and learned of their secrets, forging alliances with her body rather than a quill and ink. This proved to be Tamsine's undoing when the Matron's own guards refused to act as Kekvit drove deep a dagger into her mother's backside and into the heart. Since then, the new Matron Mother has been protected by overzealous male guards, whom often vie among themselves for the right to breed her. Even though they may often have her body, none can truly have Kekvit's heart. That belongs to another woman... her favorite consort, Nightshade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 

HouseIraeLore53T;Laela Irae;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HouseIraeLore53;Laela, the Third Irae, was next in line the moment Kaenia left on her self-exile. Neither as intelligent or as beautiful as Kaenia, nor as devious or as lustful as Kekvit, Laela had one thing going for her that made her the apple of Tamsine's eye... the girl's curse manifested itself as extreme violence. Even for a dark elf, Laela was far more violent and cruel than most. Never once has anyone seen her smile and lived. Those who did see her smile knew that it was a sign they were going to die by her hand. And it was certainly not going to be a quick death.\n  Laela's favorite pasttime was flaying her targets while they were still alive, sewing together macabre cloaks of flesh while humming along to the screams, all before severing the unfortunate victim's arteries and bathing in the blood. All the while, she ordered male bodyguards to watch. Those that flinched or showed signs of weakness would be next. Those that did not were the lucky ones, the ones she took to bed with her that night. Most did not survive the blood-fueled orgy. And all this was perfectly in line with Tamsine's plans for her daughter to one day rise up as the new Matron Mother. What the mother did not plan on was her forgotten daughter...\n  Sick and tired of Laela killing off her breeding stock, Kekvit laid down a trap for her darling sister. Taunting Laela and then running, Kekvit led her sister on a hate-fueled chase through the underworld's tunnels. Blind by her rage, the youngest sister ran right into Kekvit's trap and found herself surrounded by male bodyguards, all of whom were utterly devoted to the elder sister. For hours, the males raped Laela until they were too exhausted to continue, at which point Kekvit casted a spell that sent her younger sister to lands unknown. Of course, she dealt with the males too, leaving no witnesses. Decades later, rumors started turning up of an extremely hateful dark elf woman on the surface who seeks revenge against her sister.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

HouseIraeLore42T;The Irae Children;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeLore42;While Kekvit had many children, only three of them are held in any high regard in her eyes. All three were conceived on the same night, and were born together.\n  Freya was the first, born of the consort Nightshade's womb. The half-dragon blood flowing inside Nightshade protected the unborn Freya from the effect of the Irae family curse. As such, the girl quickly became Kekvit's favorite. Destined to inherit the throne of House Irae upon Kekvit's death, Freya led an extremely pampered childhood. Despite this, Freya was extremely ambitious, and often led raiding parties to the surface despite her mother's protests against such dangerous activities. Kekvit soon relented when it became clear that the woman was a skilled leader in her own right.\n  Khaldune, Kekvit's beloved son, was next to be born, of the Matron's own womb. Tamsine's family curse manifested itself in him as complete and utter disloyalty to anyone but the ones he loved. And Khaldune only loved two people... his little sister and his mother. All others would fear facing the wrath of his silent blade. Knowing his curse, Kekvit ordered him to never lay a finger on her consort, Nightshade, or his elder sister, Freya. But such an order would only last as long as Kekvit was alive, and she knew that one day Freya would take her life to claim the throne.\n  As if following her destiny, little Deionarra soon followed Khaldune out of Kekvit's womb. From the very start, Deionarra would never be too far behind her brother. While the girl had an affinity for magic that far surpassed Kekvit's, the family curse manifested itself in Deionarra far too early. The woman, mentally an adult, was trapped in the body of a girl no older than 13. She would never age past this. Because of this, Kekvit saw the girl as a freak of nature to be ridiculed. If it wasn't for the devotion and love from her brother- now husband- Khaldune, Deionarra would have long since taken her own life. Despite the fact that Deionarra is the very thing the Matron hates the most, Kekvit refuses to take any action against the girl or allow any harm to come to her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

HouseIraeLore43T;The Irae Consorts;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HouseIraeLore43;Nightshade Irae, the family name blessed upon her upon marriage to the Matron Mother, is a half-dragon. Born of the rape of a poor elven maiden by a dragon of the Elder Forest, the half-dragon girl was shunned by the racially-pure elves and seen as a weak half-breed by the dragons. She had no home to call her own, until one fateful day she stumbled upon a raiding party by House Irae dark elves. Quickly taken prisoner, the woman was brought before the Matron as a war trophy and slave. In an uncharacteristic gesture (at least for dark elves), Kekvit soon found herself falling in love with the woman. Though publicly the Matron treats her like a typical slave, all this is just for show. In private, she is utterly devoted to the woman, and had a private wedding ceremony performed just for the two of them. Nightshade is the only person in the world Kekvit trusts, and the woman's strength and fury made her a fine bodyguard, and the 'special addition' between the girl's legs allowed Kekvit to concieve on their wedding night, with the Matron using her own magic to return the favor.\n\n  Hell hath no fury like a Matron scorned, and the moment Kekvit found out that Tamsine bore a fourth daughter in secret, all the Abyss shuddered in fear. Little Calla Irae was just a child when her mother died and Kekvit ascended the throne of House Irae, never knowing her heritage or how much she was in danger until she grew into adulthood. Calla didn't even know her last name, but Kekvit did... the Matron could smell the Irae blood within her. But the girl was raised innocent, unknowing and uncaring about the greater political machinations around her. Her own curse manifested itself as weakness and subservience. For this reason alone the girl was spared the blade, but Kekvit still saw her as a threat to her own legitimacy and had Calla enslaved, gifted to her consort. Until such time as she earned the Irae name, Calla was Nightshade's own consort.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
