Kekvit's father now has a portrait.
The Spurned Sister's Dark Divorce reply is now translated if your character understands the language.

The various religious rituals will never remove the Drider trait if the character has that particular Tamsine curse.
Eilistraee's Tanistry law is now an Elective Tanistry, with special successor rules.
Added the start of the Dark Whispers event chain. It is still a work in progress, so enjoy the free NPC you get from it. You wont be enjoying her company for very long.
House Irae features are now available on Random/Shattered Worlds, provided the Culture and Religion Names setting is set to Historical. Don't blame me if shit gets weird all of a sudden.

Fixed the crashing bug when using House Irae with DWTweaks.

1.7

Modified every decision and event to take into account the new religion. The Spurned Sister and all characters involved in this event chain will still use the old religions. The Seldarine Republics still require the old religions, and that won't change until I test them extensively.
The death of the Spurned Sister now removes her consort's tattoo and immortality. Welcome to Dark Souls.
Edited the traits and artifacts to better reflect 3.0's change to personal combat rating and opinion modifiers.

(hotfix) Fixed the Spurned Sister CBs

 

1.4

Added new game options so you can choose where the Spurned Sister will spawn. Choosing Random will not only randomize the timeframe but also the target. This is NOT save game compatible; if she hasn't spawned in your 1.3 game yet, she never will.
The Spurned Sister and her consort will no longer be able (hopefully) to hostile to each other when they use their unique CBs.
Fixed a bug that allowed you to do an Eilistraee ritual more than once in the same ritual.
Cleaned up some lore entries in the Book of Lore.

 

1.3

1.0

Release
